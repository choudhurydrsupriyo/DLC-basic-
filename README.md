Basic pixel graphs from DLC
This is the CVS analysis for the kinematic analyis of one of our cervical dystonia patient. We get a .csv with the X,Y coordinate after DLC analysis. 
In the current code we have tried to plot the graph presenting the horizontal distance from nose to the center of body over time.
